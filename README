P4Blame will traverse a P4 graph history of a file and annotate each line with its change, date, author,
and change description.  It will travel into other branches to fine the *true* origin of the change.

This is known to work with the two latest versions of Gosu, 0.8.6 and 0.8.6.1.  Be sure you have your
GOSU_HOME environment variable set to one of these Gosu instances, and run:

    gosu p4blame.gsp

Windows users have a p4blame.cmd script which will find the gosu executable in GOSU_HOME and start the program.

Linux users can execute p4blame.gsp directly provided that they have the right version of the gosu executable
in their path.

Running the p4blame -h will provide the following help:

Usage: ./p4blame.gsp [-c path] [-h]
Options:
    -g             start a graphical frame (this is the default if no arguments are given)
    -c <path>      run blame on the given depot or local path and print to console
    -h             show this help
    -help              ''
    --help             ''
